						<p style='margin:0in;text-align:center;line-height:200%;font-size:28px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;'>Certifications and IT Degrees</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;COVID-19 has accelerated the digitalization of internal operations, supply chain, and customer interactions by three to four years (LaBerge et al., n.d., para. 1). LaBerge et al., from McKinsey &amp; Company discovered that their clients were forced to perform years of information technology (IT) work within a few months after the pandemic. Like McKinsey &amp; Company&rsquo;s clients, many organizations have significantly increased their IT efforts. These current events have increased the demand for IT professionals. Individuals interested in pursuing a career in IT will find themselves at a fork in the road that leads to certifications or IT degrees. Certifications and IT degrees have advantages and disadvantages that make them useful for different job outlooks.</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;margin-top:10px;'>Advantages</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;'>Certifications</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>There are some advantages to obtaining certifications for IT jobs. &ldquo;For individuals looking for entry-level IT roles, having certain certifications will help demonstrate your proficiency with particular tools or frameworks&rdquo; (Stobierski, 2021, para. 8). As Stobierski states, certifications are specialized and help demonstrate proficiency to employers. Other advantages of certifications are that they are inexpensive and can be completed within weeks. The low cost and short timeframe to obtain certifications make them a good choice for individuals working full-time. Another advantage of certifications is that the skills acquired through them are specific. This means job-searching is simplified because it can be filtered to those needing talent with that certification.</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;margin-top:10px;margin-top:10px;'>IT Degrees</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>There are many advantages to obtaining an IT degree for a job in information technology. For example, Amsler (2021) states that individuals with four-year degrees are the hire of choice for employers over those with only certifications (para. 19). Generally, four-year degrees are preferred over certifications. Other advantages of IT degrees are that they last forever and pave the way for significant growth. When obtaining an IT degree, there is no need to renew or re-learn the latest content. Once an IT degree is achieved, it is honored for life. IT degrees also pave the way for higher levels of learning, like master and doctorate degrees. When earning graduate-level degrees, the pay range increases as well. Another unique advantage of accredited undergraduate IT degrees is that they can be used to pursue graduate degrees in other fields, like a master&rsquo;s in business administration (MBA).</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;margin-top:10px;'>Disadvantages</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;'>Certifications</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Although there are many advantages to obtaining IT certifications, there are also some disadvantages. Certifications hyper-focus on a technology, framework, or service, and advancements require re-learning and re-certification after a few years (Amsler, 2021, para. 18). As Amsler states, IT certifications do not last long. Recertification can be a tedious and time-consuming task. Each time a certification test is taken, a fee is incurred, which means that failure will result in a complete loss of funds. In some cases, IT professionals will have multiple certifications. The headaches of paying for and taking the time to take tests are multiplied by each certification that requires renewal.</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;margin-top:10px;'>IT Degrees</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>There are also many disadvantages to obtaining IT degrees. Clarke (2021) states that IT degrees are expensive and a lengthy process (para. 5). IT degrees are four-year commitments on average. The typical full-time student will take four three-credit-hour classes, amounting to 12 credits per semester. At this rate, a degree is completed within four years, but if the student also has a full-time job, they may only be able to take two classes. Reducing productivity time in half significantly elongated the time to complete the degree. The price of attending a university to obtain an undergraduate degree like a bachelor&rsquo;s is incredibly high. The price alone can be a deciding factor in choosing not to pursue this path.</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;margin-top:10px;'>Job Outlook</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;'>Certifications</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>The job outlook in the IT field for certifications is positive. &ldquo;Health care, education, and government service are the leading sectors in which most workers with no postsecondary education have a certification&rdquo; (Lumina Foundation, 2020, p. 2). As the Lumina Foundation reports, health care, education, and government services are prime employers for IT professionals that only have certifications. Typically, the IT positions readily available for individuals with certifications are entry-level. Professional development is highly obtainable by individuals that enter jobs with certifications. With experience and practice, more advanced certifications can be obtained, helping individuals move up in a company. With years of hard work and dedication, executive positions can be reached through the certification path.</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;margin-top:10px;'>IT Degrees</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>The job outlook for individuals with IT degrees is slightly better than for those with certifications. Individuals with an IT degree are candidates for any job that certifications can obtain, but &ldquo;[c]hief information officers [(CIOs)] have at least a bachelor&apos;s degree in IT, computer science, database administration or related field&rdquo; (Powers, 2022, para. 12). As Powers states, administrative and leadership roles, like that of the CIO, are typically exclusively for individuals with IT degrees. It is possible to reach these executive-level positions with certifications, but not common. Other jobs that are usually only available for individuals with IT degrees are research jobs. Due to the broad spectrum of IT education gained through an IT degree, many more options are available when seeking a job. In contrast, someone with certifications can only apply to positions that need a specific set of skills.</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-align:center;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;margin-top:10px;'>Conclusion</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>In conclusion, certifications and IT degrees have advantages and disadvantages that make them useful for different job outlooks. The quarantine guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the coronavirus disease served as a catalyst to digitalize business models. With in-person meetings and crowded offices deemed unsafe, business processes moved to a format that enables employees to be in isolation. Employees began to work from home, and retail stores scrambled to transition their shopping experience from in-person to online. IT specialists made it possible for employees to work from home through virtualization. The work of IT professionals enhanced online shopping experiences. IT professionals with certifications and degrees made it possible to virtualize in-person business. Organizations of all kinds are wise to hire talent with IT degrees and certifications.</p>
