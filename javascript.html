						<p style='margin:0in;text-align:center;line-height:200%;font-size:28px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;'>JavaScript</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever had ten days off and did not know what to do? If so, you are not alone. Others on Quora have asked what to do with so much free time. Disha Jain provided an answer by suggesting cleaning, bird watching, and dancing (2016). In 1995, Brendan Eich, a Netscape programmer, decided to take a different approach and created JavaScript in those ten days (Checkmarx Team, 2018, para. 1). The programming language was thought &ldquo;immature&rdquo; but has risen above the rest and become a standard for website development. Although there are things to watch out for, JavaScript is essential for web development projects due to its special functionality and key features.</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;margin-top:10px;'>Functionality</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;'>Interpreted</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>One of the functional characteristics of JavaScript is that it is considered an interpreted programming language. &ldquo;[T]his means that the JavaScript engine (interpreter) reads JavaScript statements one at a time and executes them immediately&rdquo; (Telang, n.d., para. 3). Being an interpreted language has its advantages, and JavaScript has taken advantage of this by allowing itself to be platform-independent. This independence enables JavaScript to run on multiple platforms. Although interpreted languages are viewed as &ldquo;slower&rdquo; languages, the runtime speeds of JavaScript are not hindered due to advances in today&rsquo;s technology.</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;margin-top:10px;'>Dynamically Typed</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>A second functional characteristic of JavaScript is that it is dynamically typed. Dynamically typed programming languages do not require variable-type specifications while writing code (Telang, n.d., para. 6). Without the need to specify variable types in writing code, programmers can focus more on the top-level functionality of the code. Worrying about having a string, integer, or float is a thing of the past with JavaScript. An additional benefit of the dynamic characteristic of JavaScript is that the variables are subject to change.</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;margin-top:10px;'>First-Class Functions</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>A third functional characteristic of JavaScript is first-class functions. First-class functions mean that &ldquo;you can pass functions as arguments to other functions or return them from functions&rdquo; (Telang, n.d., para. 6). The ability to use functions in this manner allows functions to rely on the response or output of other functions for increased versatility. A real-world example of this can be seen on any clothing and apparel website. When selecting a product, the available sizes for that product appear. With products that have multiple color/pattern variations, selecting a size will highlight the available colors/patterns and grey out the rest.</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;margin-top:10px;'>Closures</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>A fourth functional characteristic of JavaScript is closures. &ldquo;Closures is a programming concept in which any variable declared inside a function can be accessed by any other nested function within the same scope&rdquo; (Telang, n.d., para. 7). This characteristic can be seen in many other programming languages and is a helpful inclusion in JavaScript. There are many use-cases where this is useful. This functionality allows JavaScript to be written more compactly, allowing for more clean code.</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;margin-top:10px;'>Key Features</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;'>Static to Dynamic</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>A key feature of JavaScript is turning static code into dynamic code. Initially, websites could not perform actions, and content was &ldquo;informational only.&rdquo; JavaScript has changed this by allowing sites to be much more interactive. With user interactivity, like a click of a button, JavaScript can change CSS or HTML elements (W3Schools.com, n.d.-a). This means that the actual content on a website can change, or the styling of the website can be changed with the use of JavaScript.</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;margin-top:10px;'>Browser Control</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Additionally, another key feature of JavaScript is browser control. &ldquo;JavaScript being a client-side language provides many features that help developers to divide processing between browser and server hence reducing the load on servers by having basic processing, validations, temporary data saving using cookies, etc. on the browser itself.&rdquo; (studytonight.com, n.d., para. 12). Study Tonight provides incredible insight into the ability of JavaScript to control browsers and data. Code workload can be divided between server and client resources. &nbsp;The article adds that JavaScript can detect browser types and operating system versions. These features are handy for website creation because code can be written to act differently depending on browser types and versions. Debugging boosts productivity with the client data that can be provided with JavaScript.</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;margin-top:10px;'>Cautions</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;'>Object Management</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>JavaScript is a beneficial programming language, although some precautions must be taken. One thing to take into consideration is object management. &ldquo;With five objects, even if each one draws on the services of all the others, there are at most 20 channels of communication (each of 5 objects calling 4 others&mdash;allowing ourselves to count A calling B as well as B calling A). With 50, there are 2450 (50 times 49)&mdash;more than 100 times as many&rdquo; (Ullman, 2012, p. 16). Ullman explains the interconnectivity possibilities of objects when they can be controlled and when they can be completely uncontrollable. Objects can call on each other and thus are connected, but when the number of objects is too high, the number of possibilities increases exponentially. It is best to keep the objects and connections between them at a minimum to avoid losing track of connections. Not taking into consideration of Ullman&rsquo;s advice can lead to disastrous debugging.</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;margin-top:10px;'>Browser Compatibility</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Another caution to take is that of browser compatibility. There may be nearly 100 or more current available browsers to use, and the code is written must be compatible with all or at least all the most popular browsers. &ldquo;Test your scripts on every browser/platform combination you possibly can!&rdquo; (Hedges, 2003). Hedges&rsquo;s words of wisdom may sound a bit outlandish, but he is right. Testing scripts is essential because a website may look and act differently depending on the browser or even the platform it is being viewed on. At the very least, it is important to test the most popular browsers and platforms.</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;margin-top:10px;'>Reserved Words</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>Lastly, another caution to take with JavaScript is reserved words. This is not new to programming languages, as all other programming languages also have words that cannot be used when assigning variables. Nonetheless, it is important to note that JavaScript lists pre-assigned words that cannot be reused for variables. The W3Schools.com website shows that a few words that JavaScript reserves are abstract, final, yield, typeof, synchronized, eval, package, and throw (W3Schools.com, n.d.-b).</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-align:center;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-weight:bold;margin-top:10px;'>Conclusion</p>
						<p style='margin:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>In conclusion, there may be some things to watch out for with JavaScript, but its functionality and key features make it an essential programming language for web development projects. It becomes clear that websites would not be the interactive beauties they are today without the use of JavaScript. Web development projects implement JavaScript for a touch of elegance and user interactivity when ready for it. It is not easy to believe that such a widely-used programming language as JavaScript was developed in 10 days. It must be incredible for Brendan Eich, now 60 years old and still active in the tech community, to have the power to access his creation globally. It leaves us to wonder what else is possible with the worldwide web</p>
